## Getting Started

Mental health is considered to be an indispensable part of our overall health system. Solving mental issues does not only mean curing mental health disorders, but also creating comfort and confidence in ourselves, and the ability to be aware of our potential.

The general idea related to mental problems and psychosocial problems are both significantly increasing in Vietnam, especially in children and teenagers. With certain drawbacks of some service centers of mental health, psychosocial in the patronage center, consulting room at school, and the quality and the coverage in awareness of mental health are still limited.

## Our solution

With the goal of Health and Wellbeing in 17 sustainable development goals of the United Nation and associative with Google technologies: Flutter, Google Cloud and Firebase, we advocate that the autism or depression problems would rapidly decrease.

### Find the doctor

The application is made to help the ones having mental issues quickly find out their appropriate counselors. This function not only allows them to reach a doctor in time, but is also relevant to their schedule, goals and demands.

With Google Cloud, which provides a Map API, we can easily track the location of any doctors and peers that reduce the distance between each others, help them get on well with the community.

### Community

We provide a community for any patients to share their results or current emotions to motivate others, in terms of increasing the connectivity of the community.

With Firebase, we can easily store data securely and safely. 

### Quotes & To-do list

The application also can be a close partner in any situation, which motivates you by quoting systems, and reminds you to do some changes to cure your soul.

## Conclusion

With this solution, we believe that there are no more issues about school bullying and autism among teenagers or young generations in general. With the collaboration with schools and parents in terms of education for their teenagers, we claim that, within the following 5 years, Me.care would be ubiquitous throughout Vietnam and publishing in the world. At the moment, this app is in development and will be available on both Android and iOS. Thank you!
